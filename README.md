# Myday_to_Obsidian

**MyDay to Obsidian** is a plugin designed to seamlessly store your daily tasks from Microsoft To Do into Obsidian. Since Microsoft To Do does not provide a way to save your **My Day** section, this tool automatically records what you planned and completed each day. It helps you track past tasks, reflect on productivity, and retrieve important information when needed. Whether for personal organization or future reference, **MyDay to Obsidian** ensures that your daily progress is never lost.
